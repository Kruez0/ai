# Groq Chatbot
Did it by looking at laoshi's code.
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to use the Groq API to generate chat completions. The script initializes a Groq client and creates a function to get chat completions based on user input. You can interact with the chatbot through the command line!

User: Hello
Response: Hi there! How can I help you today?

User: Tell me a joke.
Response: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!

User: quit
Bye!
