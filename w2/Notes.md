For the first part of the code is the same as teachers' code. the next part is what i did by myself. I use youtube videos to understand the concept and chatgpt to only help me remember the things that i forgot and all the things i missed. 

To finish this homework, I watch youtube videos about methods to calculate distance from coordinate and also found out about heuristic method.
so heuristic method is a method that got not the most optimal solution but still produce a good result. In this method, I first make a random start point and then try to find the shortest distance possible to go to another coordinate. after I found the shortest distance, I move on to that new coordinate and find again another shortest distance from that new coordinate. This all went on until all the coordinates are visited and i finally got the shortest path, total distance, and the coordinates from this heuristic method.
